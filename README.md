### Goals
This project aims to make you discover, via several small challenges, the exploitation
tation of elf-type binary in an i386 system.

The methods you are going to use, more or less complex, you will see different
remembers IT in general and especially to become aware of the problems
poor programming practices.

During this project, you will surely encounter difficulties: let's be clear, these
difficulties, you must overcome them on your own. Your approach to
different trials really and only come from YOU. The interest here is on you
develop a certain logic and acquire reflexes that will follow you through
the following. Before asking for help, ask yourself if you've really thought about it
